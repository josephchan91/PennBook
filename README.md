#PennBook

##&nbsp;
A project I worked on with my partner Xiao Li for MKSE 212 - Scalable and Cloud Computing, taught by Professor Haeberlen at Penn. PennBook is a mini-Social Network built on GWT and served by Jetty on Amazon EC2. It is backed by Amazon's SimpleDB, and makes use of Twitter's Bootstrap collection for the UI.
